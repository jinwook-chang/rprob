# rprob

`rprob` is a Python package that provides a `R` style collection of functions for generating random numbers, computing densities, distribution functions, quantile functions, and more for various statistical distributions.

## Installation

To install `rprob`, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install rprob
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use `rprob` to generate random numbers from a normal distribution:

```python
from rprob import rnorm

random_numbers = rnorm(100)
print(random_numbers)
```
